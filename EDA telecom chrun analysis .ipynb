on which a telecom company have to focus to reduce Churnout rate\n","\n","1) Check the number of customer in each and every state and do some required things like increasing the man power, change in customer handeling excersies with respect to the volume, train manpower to handle high volume of customers etc.\n","\n","2) The company have to focus on newley added customers because after knowing their expecations with the comapny, that company can serve that customer better, once that customer adjusted with that company , the chancec of churning out that customer is reduced.\n","\n","3) The rate of churn out customer is high when they did not suscribed the international pack, so, offer customer an international plan to reduce chance of him/her to churn out.\n","\n","4) The churning ratio of the customers who calls internationally more often is very less, so try to target those customer to be a part of this company who calls internationally more often.\n","\n","5) Subscription of voice mail plan with international plan give the best retention rate to a company.\n","\n","6) Charges spent by the customers is high in day time for same minutes and same number of calls done in night so, make some discount for customers who spent more on calls in day time.\n","\n","7) Do some serious focus on those customers who called more than thrice to customer service. Because the chances of churning out from the company increases when number of service calls increases from customer side."],"metadata":{"id":"YRI457iuSvsM"}}]}
